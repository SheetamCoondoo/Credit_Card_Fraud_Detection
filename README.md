# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

The Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning** project focuses on developing a logistic regression model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Utilizing a dataset of credit card transactions, the model is trained on features such as transaction amount, time, card type, and country, with the goal of predicting the likelihood of fraud. The scikit-learn package in Python was utilized to implement the model, and it is assessed based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score. The model was useful in identifying fraudulent activity, achieving a high accuracy of 96.55% on the test dataset and 98.70% on the training dataset. The study demonstrates how machine learning may be used to detect fraud, and there are plans to gather more data, investigate other techniques, and use the model in a production ready environment.
